I developed this game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
You have to guess what the number is, this number is in the range 1-20.
a) If you enter a higher number, you will be warned with the phrase "Too high!".
b) If you enter a number that is too small, you will be warned with the phrase "Too low!".
c) If you enter a number smaller than 1, you will be warned with the phrase "No number!".
d) If you guessed the number, the background will turn green and you will be warned with the phrase "Correct Number!".
You will be able to continue the game by pressing the button "Again!" from the upper-left side, and once you press it, the Highscore will be memorized.
